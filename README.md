# Read Me First
This application is ***INCOMPATIBLE*** with **Windows' contrast theme setting** because of the effects it applies to the application windows.

Unless you want an *unreadable, and in my opinion, ugly-looking window*, ***DO NOT ENABLE THIS THEME*** or have the application running while contrast theme settings are enabled.

# Snipper-v2
### Description
I made a scuffed version of Windows 10 snipping tool.

Works with Windows 11 of course :)

### Features
  - Region selection
    - Modifiable X, Y, Width, Height
    - Prevents you from scrolling to a value too low or too high
  - Set region to match screen
    - Screen selection is based on which screen contains the ***majority of the application window itself***
  - Save screenshot
    - Saves the screenshotted image to your computer through a file dialog
    - Saves only in the [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) format since every pixel of the image will have an **alpha value** of ***255***, making it a *solid color* pixel.
  - Take screenshot
    - Creates a bitmap of the screen itself using the specified region in the window's image settings
  - Toggleable region preview
    - A button next to the save button that toggles the ***Visibility of the region preview application window***
